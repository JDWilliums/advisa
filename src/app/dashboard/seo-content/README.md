This comprehensive SEO analysis tool provides detailed insights into website SEO performance with actionable recommendations for improvement.

## System Architecture

The SEO analyzer follows a client-server architecture with several key components:

### Frontend Components

- **SEOAnalyzer Component** (`components/SEOAnalyzer.tsx`): The main UI component that displays the analysis interface and results
- **Type Definitions** (`types/seo.ts`): TypeScript interfaces defining the structure of SEO analysis data

### Backend Components

- **API Route** (`/api/analyze-seo/route.ts`): Next.js API route that receives analysis requests from the client
- **Analysis Engine** (`api/analyze-seo.ts`): Core analysis functionality that orchestrates the SEO evaluation process
- **Browser Integration** (`api/browser-launcher.ts`): Puppeteer integration for web scraping and analysis
- **Analysis Modules** (`api/analysis/*.ts`): Individual analysis modules for different SEO aspects

## Analysis Process

1. **User Input**: User enters a URL in the interface (HTTPS:// is automatically added if missing)
2. **Request Handling**: The client makes a POST request to `/api/analyze-seo` with the URL and depth parameter
3. **Browser Initialization**: The system initializes Puppeteer to analyze the target website
4. **Multi-aspect Analysis**: Several specialized modules analyze different aspects of SEO:
   - Meta Tags Analysis: Evaluates title, description, keywords, canonical URLs, etc.
   - Headings Analysis: Checks heading structure, count, and content
   - Content Analysis: Assesses word count, readability, keyword density
   - Images Analysis: Checks for alt text, image sizes, and optimization
   - Performance Analysis: Measures load time and other performance metrics
   - Links Analysis: Analyzes internal/external links and identifies broken links
   - Security Analysis: Checks for HTTPS and security headers
   - Mobile Optimization: Evaluates mobile-friendliness (standard/deep analysis only)
   - Accessibility: Assesses accessibility features (deep analysis only)
   - Structured Data: Checks for structured data implementation (standard/deep analysis only)
5. **Scoring and Recommendations**: The system calculates scores for each category and an overall score, then generates actionable recommendations
6. **Result Storage**: Results are returned to the client and stored in localStorage for future reference

## Data Storage

Analysis results are stored as "Saved Reports" in the browser's localStorage:

- **Storage Key**: `seoAnalysisHistory`
- **Storage Format**: Array of HistoryItem objects containing:
  - URL analyzed
  - Date of analysis
  - Overall score
  - Complete analysis results
- **Retention Policy**: Up to 10 most recent analyses are stored
- **Persistence**: Data persists between browser sessions until cache/local storage is cleared

## Key Features

### Analysis Capabilities

- **Multiple Analysis Depths**: 
  - `basic`: Fast analysis of core SEO elements
  - `standard`: Comprehensive analysis including mobile optimization and structured data
  - `deep`: In-depth analysis including accessibility features

### User Interface

- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark Mode Support**: Complete dark mode implementation
- **Interactive Results**: Detailed breakdown of SEO performance with visualization
- **History Management**: Access and load previous analyses without re-analyzing

### Performance Optimizations

- **Mock Mode**: Development mode that returns sample data without running Puppeteer
- **Resource Filtering**: Blocks unnecessary resources during analysis to improve performance
- **Timeout Handling**: Graceful handling of sites that take too long to load

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `USE_MOCK_SEO`: When set to 'true', returns mock data instead of performing analysis
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_MODE`: Enables detailed logging when set to 'true'
- `BLOCK_RESOURCES`: When 'true', blocks images/media/fonts during analysis for better performance

### Next.js Configuration

The `next.config.ts` file includes several important configurations:

- **Server Packages**: Specifies server-only packages to prevent client-side bundling issues
- **Webpack Config**: Excludes server-only packages from client-side bundles
- **Environment Variables**: Makes server-side variables available to the application

## Technical Implementation Details

### Browser Integration

The system uses Puppeteer to analyze websites through a headless Chrome browser. Different initialization strategies are used based on the environment:

- **Development**: Uses locally installed Chrome or Puppeteer's bundled browser
- **Production**: Uses chrome-aws-lambda for serverless compatibility

### Error Handling

The system implements robust error handling:

- **URL Validation**: Ensures valid URLs with proper formatting
- **Browser Launch Failures**: Graceful fallback if browser initialization fails
- **Network Errors**: Comprehensive handling of connection issues
- **Timeout Management**: Handles sites that take too long to load

### Data Flow

1. User input → Client-side validation
2. API request → Server-side validation
3. Browser initialization → Page loading
4. Multi-module analysis → Data collection
5. Score calculation → Recommendation generation
6. Response formatting → Data storage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Network Error**: 
   - Check if the target URL is accessible
   - Verify server connectivity
   - Try using mock mode for testing

2. **Browser Launch Fails**:
   - Ensure Chrome is installed on the server
   - Check for permission issues
   - Try specifying the Chrome path explicitly

3. **Memory/Performance Issues**:
   - Use basic analysis mode for large websites
   - Enable resource blocking
   - Consider increasing server memory allocation

4. **API Timeout**:
   - Check for slow-loading websites
   - Increase the API timeout limit
   - Implement chunked analysis for large sites

### Debugging

- Enable debug mode by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_MODE=true`
- Check browser console and server logs for error messages
- Use the browser test utility to verify Puppeteer functionality

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Storage Improvements**:
   - Implement server-side storage for cross-device access
   - Add database integration for permanent storage
   - Enable export/import functionality for reports

2. **Analysis Enhancements**:
   - Add competitor analysis capabilities
   - Implement keyword research integration
   - Create scheduled/automated analyses

3. **User Experience**:
   - Implement PDF report generation
   - Add visual comparison between analyses
   - Create email notifications for changes

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement caching for frequently analyzed sites
   - Add distributed analysis for very large websites
   - Create worker-based parallel processing

## Development Guidelines

When extending this tool, follow these guidelines:

1. **Modularity**: Keep analysis modules separate and focused on specific aspects
2. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in all new components
3. **UI Consistency**: Maintain the design language and dark mode support
4. **Performance**: Be mindful of browser/server resource usage
5. **Documentation**: Update this README with any significant changes
